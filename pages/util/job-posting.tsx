				<p className="mt-2">
					Choose from a plethora of job opportunities that await you in
					Wicketâ€”from ones that might spark your interest to discover and
					experience new things, to the ones that are tailored and recommended
					just for you based on your currently possessed skills!
				</p>
				<p className="mt-2">
					Interested but not ready to commit just yet? You may also save the job
					posts that grabbed your attention and get back to them at a later time
					(as long as they are available still) when you are feeling more like
					your go-getter self.

				<p className="mt-2">
					Finding jobs can be overwhelming not just for first-time job seekers,
					but also for those that continue to pursue more than just bill-paying
					jobs.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-2">
					Keep your head cool, your efforts given its deserved acknowledgement,
					and take advantage of Wicket&apos;s job search function. Search for
					the specific job vacancies you deem will serve as a cornerstone to
					your journey towards your goal, save time you might as well spend on
					practicing job interview scenarios, and take that first step (which
					might be a little scary but will definitely be worth the risk)!
