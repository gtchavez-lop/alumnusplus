					<strong>Overview:</strong>
				</p>

				<p className="mt-2">
					Immerse yourself inside Wicket&apos;s metaverseâ€”dress (your
					metaverse-self) to impress, explore the different venues selected for
					a scheduled event, seize your moment to appeal to employers during
					initial assessments, and land that job you have always been dreaming
					of!
				</p>
				<p className="mt-2">
					Forget about ruining your perfectly pressed business attires and
					slicked-back hairstyles to hot and humid and, often, sweaty trips to
					job fair venues; or standing in line among long queue of candidates,
					never quite sure if you&apos;ll get your chance before the
					event&apos;s cut-off time; or, even with a slightly lower possibility
					but is for sure the worst of them all, getting lost on your way to the
					venue.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-2">
					Right where you would be most comfortable at, plop down, stretch,
					prepare your note-taking and &qout;taking-care-of-myself&qout; kits,
					and participate in the virtual job fairs and other events happening in
					Wicket&apos;s metaverse (plus you would not even have to ask random
					people where the comfort room is anymore)!
